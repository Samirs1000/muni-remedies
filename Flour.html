			<h3>No more burns and blisters</h3>
			<p>Some time ago I was cooking some corn and stuck my fork in the boiling water to see if the corn was ready. I missed and my hand went into the boiling water....!!</p>
			<p>A friend of mine, who was a Vietnam vet, came into the house, as I was screaming, and asked me if I had some plain old wheat flour... I pulled out a bag and he stuck my hand in it. He told me to keep my hand in the flour for 10 minutes. He said, In Vietnam , there was a guy on fire and in their panic, they threw a bag of flour all over him to put the fire out...Well, it not only put the fire out, but he <b>never even had a blister!!!!</b></p>
			<p>Long story short, I put my hand in the bag of flour for 10 mins, pulled it out and did not even have a red mark or a blister and absolutely <b>NO PAIN.</b></p>
			<p>Now, I keep a bag of flour in the fridge and every time I burn myself. *Cold flour feels even better than room temperature flour. I use the wheat flour and have never ever had even a red spot/burn mark, or a blister! I even burnt my tongue once, put the flour on it for about 10 minutes .... the pain was gone and no burn.</p>
			<p>Try it . . . Experience a miracle!</p>
			<p>Keep a bag of flour in your fridge and you will be happy you did!</p>
			<p>Flour has heat absorbant property and also is strong antioxident property. Thus helps in burns patient if apllied within 15 minutes.</p>

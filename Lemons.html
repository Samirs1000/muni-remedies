			<h2>Lemons</h2>
			<h3>Cures cancer, infections, lowers blood pressure and more...</h3>
			<p>Place the washed lemon in the freezer. Once frozen, get your grater, & shred the whole lemon (no need to peel it) and sprinkle it on your foods! On vegetables, salad, ice cream, soup, cereals, noodles, spaghetti sauce,
			rice, sushi, fish dishes, ... the list is endless.</p>
			<p>All the foods will get an unexpected wonderful taste!</p>
			<p>Most likely, you only think of lemon juice as vitamin C ??</p>
			<p>Not anymore!</p>
			<p>What's the major advantage of using the whole lemon other than preventing waste and adding new taste to your dishes?</p>
			<p>Lemon peels contain as much as 5 to 10x more vitamins than the lemon juice itself and that's what you've been wasting!</p>
			<p>Lemon peels are health rejuvenators in eradicating toxic elements in the body.</p>
			<p>The surprising benefits of lemon is the miraculous ability to kill cancer cells! It is 10,000 times stronger than chemotherapy!!</p>
			<p>Why do we not know about that?</p>
			<!--Hover over and shows "because its not true"-->
			<p>Because there are laboratories interested in making a synthetic version that will bring them huge profits.</p>
			<!--Hover over and shows "again not true, I work in the pharmaceutical industry and this is not how medicines and research work in the real world"-->
			<p>This plant is a proven remedy against cancers of all types.</p>
			<p>It is considered also as an anti microbial spectrum against bacterial infections and fungi, effective against internal parasites and worms, it regulates blood pressure and an antidepressant, combats stress and nervous disorders.</p>
			The source of this information is fascinating: it comes from one of the largest drug manufacturers in the world,
			<!--Hover over and shows "not named??"--> says that after more than 20 laboratory tests since 1970,the extracts revealed that it destroys the malignant cells in 12 cancers, including colon, breast, prostate, lung and pancreas...
			<!--Hover over and shows "why do people still die if this was the case...do people actually believe this stuff?"--></p>
			<p>The compounds of this tree showed 10,000 times better effect than the product Adriamycin, a drug normally used chemotherapeutic in the world, slowing the growth of cancer cells. And what is even more astonishing: this type of therapy with lemon extract only destroys malignant cancer cells and it does not affect healthy cells.</p>
			<p>So, give those lemons a good wash, freeze them and grate them. Your whole body will love you for it!!</p>
